<h1><strong>CONTEXT</strong></h1>
<p>FIFA 20 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series. EA has been making games based on FIFA since 1993. Along with Madden NFL, it forms the backbone of the EA Sports brand. As of 2018, the series had sold over 260 million copies. The latest version in the series FIFA 20, released on 27 September 2019, had 10 million players within two weeks of launch.</p>
<h4><strong>Little Preview </strong></h4>
<p>Every year, ahead of the latest FIFA video game release, EA Sports reveals the FUT (FIFA Ultimate Team) card player ratings sending social media into meltdown. While fans debate the ratings with excitement and fervour, players tag EA Sports in their posts demanding an explanation for their underrated skills. Some are livid, some are embarrassed, some just want their haircut updated. Their ratings are an extension of their ego and they consider a poor round of ratings a slap in the face. Cristiano Ronaldo, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, when presented with his 93-rated FIFA 20 card last year, scribbled out his score and replaced it with 100 on a live show.</p>
